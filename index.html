        <h3>Background of the Problem</h3>
        <p>Many Filipinos, particularly those from marginalized communities, struggle to access legal assistance and understand their rights, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation and injustice. According to a 2019 survey by the World Justice Project, 35% of Filipinos experienced a legal problem in the preceding two years, yet only 20% of them were able to access information, advice, or representation. Of those who obtained assistance, merely 15% received help from a lawyer or professional advice service, and 9% from a government legal aid office.</p>
        <p>Recognizing this issue, the Supreme Court of the Philippines approved the Rules on Unified Legal Aid Service (ULAS) in November 2024, requiring lawyers to provide at least 60 hours of pro bono legal aid every three years to indigent Filipinos who cannot afford legal representation (Supreme Court of the Philippines, 2024).</p>
        <p>Despite these efforts, challenges persist. A report from Manila Bulletin highlights that ensuring justice for the poor requires more than free legal services; systemic injustices must also be addressed (Manila Bulletin, 2024). Additionally, the Philippines’ civil justice index score for impartial and accessible dispute resolution was 0.63 out of 1 in 2024, showing the need for further improvements in legal accessibility (Statista, 2024).</p>
        <p>These findings emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive legal aid and public legal education to empower marginalized communities and ensure equitable access to justice.</p>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <h4>Who are the main providers of pro bono:</h4>
        <p>NGOs, government agencies, public services, schools, universities, and private law firms all play a role in pro bono work. However, foreign lawyers and law firms are prohibited from offering pro bono services in the Philippines (Latham & Watkins LLP, 2019).</p>

        <h4>Process in applying for pro bono:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify the legal issue, gather relevant information and documentation.</li>
            <li>Consult with an attorney or legal expert, free legal advice is available in PAO and legal aid clinics.</li>
            <li>Apply for legal assistance, submit an application form with supporting documents demonstrating financial need.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Eligibility for pro bono:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Financial Need - Pro bono services are mainly for people who cannot afford a lawyer. Financial need is usually based on income and assets. It’s best to check with local legal aid organizations or pro bono providers for their specific requirements.</li>
            <li>Merit of the Case - Pro bono legal services often prioritize cases that have a good chance of success or address important public issues. However, this may depend on the availability of free legal help and the priorities of each lawyer or law firm.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pro Bono vs Free Consultation:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Pro bono services are completely free and typically offered to those who cannot afford legal assistance (e.g., indigent clients).
            </li>
            <li>
                A free consultation is just an initial discussion with a professional at no cost, but it does not guarantee free legal representation or continued assistance.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Are there existing platforms?</h4>
        <p>The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) launched the Pro Bono Portal (PBP) in April 2023 to provide indigent litigants with online access to free legal services. However, there the PBP is no longer accessible, and the IBP's official website does not provide updates on its current status. Individuals seeking pro bono legal services must apply in person at local PAOs.</p>
